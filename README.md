### Abstract
In this project we implement a FIR filter co-processor in FPGA (**ARTY xc7a35tcsg324-1**), along with input/output data storage and transfer protocols. In particular, we use the IPbus protocol for communication with the FPGA board and a DPRAM component as memory source. We test the hardware implementation of the filter on several input waveforms and we compare the results with the ones obtained through a Python simulation.
